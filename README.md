# Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction
This work aims to accurately predict Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) using a robust Artificial Neural Network model and compares its performance to various machine learning algorithms, ultimately achieving an impressive accuracy of 98%, making it a promising tool for CKD diagnosis.

## Motivation
The motivation for advancing the predictive accuracy of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) prediction is underscored by compelling statistics. Globally, CKD affects approximately 10% of the population, with an alarming 90% of cases remaining undiagnosed until reaching advanced stages. Improved accuracy in prediction models holds the potential to address this concerning trend by enabling early detection in a substantial number of cases, potentially reducing the incidence of CKD-related complications by a significant percentage.

Furthermore, the economic impact is substantial, with CKD management accounting for an estimated 2% to 3% of total healthcare expenditures globally. By optimizing resource allocation through accurate predictions, healthcare providers can make substantial cost savings, potentially resulting in millions of dollars redirected towards other critical healthcare needs.

Moreover, considering that CKD is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, refining predictive models not only holds the potential to improve individual patient outcomes but also contributes to broader public health goals, aligning with global efforts to tackle the growing burden of non-communicable diseases. This pursuit of accuracy is essential for shaping effective healthcare strategies and research initiatives, ultimately enhancing the quality of life for millions affected by CKD.

The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) architecture employs Rectified Linear Unit (ReLu) activation functions in both the input and hidden layers, with a sigmoid activation function in the output layer to predict the binary outcome of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) prediction. The model utilizes binary cross-entropy as the loss function and the Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) optimizer, tailored for binary data, to optimize its parameters. After rigorous testing of various classification algorithms, the ANN demonstrated the highest accuracy. The custom ANN architecture includes three hidden layers with respective unit configurations of {32, 16, 8}. It operates with a learning rate of 0.01 and a batch size of 8 during training, with a total of 50 epochs to fine-tune the model's performance. This architecture is designed to effectively predict the presence or absence of CKD with the provided hyperparameters and configurations.

abstract="Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is one of the most critical diseases in today's day and age, and its accurate and thorough diagnosis is the need of the hour. This work aims to accurately predict CKD in a patient with the help of machine learning by developing a robust artificial neural network model which would vastly benefit the healthcare industry. It takes into account every criterion and predicts whether the subject may encounter CKD or not. An empirical comparison of the efficiency of various machine learning algorithms such as random forest classifier, extra trees classifier, K-nearest neighbors, gradient boosting classifier, stochastic gradient boosting, cat boost classifier, light gradient boosting machine, and decision tree classifier is also portrayed in this research. The algorithms implemented on preprocessed data gave accuracies of not more than 95{\%}. This work has implemented a modified artificial neural network which predicted whether a patient has CKD or not with an accuracy of 98{\%}, which surpassed that of all the other classification algorithms that were compared. The proposed model may serve as an effective and accurate tool to predict the occurrence of CKD in a patient.",
