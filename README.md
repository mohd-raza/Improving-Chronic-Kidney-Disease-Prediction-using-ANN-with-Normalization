# Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction

Optimizing the accuracy of Chronic Kidney Disease prediction through the use of feature engineering approaches such as Data Normalization and Standardization.

## Motivation

The motivation for advancing the predictive accuracy of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) prediction is underscored by compelling statistics. Globally, CKD affects approximately 10% of the population, with an alarming 90% of cases remaining undiagnosed until reaching advanced stages. Improved accuracy in prediction models holds the potential to address this concerning trend by enabling early detection in a substantial number of cases, potentially reducing the incidence of CKD-related complications by a significant percentage.

Furthermore, the economic impact is substantial, with CKD management accounting for an estimated 2% to 3% of total healthcare expenditures globally. By optimizing resource allocation through accurate predictions, healthcare providers can make substantial cost savings, potentially resulting in millions of dollars redirected towards other critical healthcare needs.

Moreover, considering that CKD is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, refining predictive models not only holds the potential to improve individual patient outcomes but also contributes to broader public health goals, aligning with global efforts to tackle the growing burden of non-communicable diseases. This pursuit of accuracy is essential for shaping effective healthcare strategies and research initiatives, ultimately enhancing the quality of life for millions affected by CKD.
